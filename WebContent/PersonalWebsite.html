				<h3><u>My Programming History.</u></h3>
				<p>My name is Jacob Miller and I am currently a Grand Circus Java student.
				 I've had small bits of exposure to programming over the past five years or so.
				 I was introduced to programming in high school when I signed up for a java class just because I liked computers and video games
				 I really enjoyed the class but it seemed like we didn't go that deep into the language. I now know that that was true.
				 I wanted to continue programming into college but the java course was full and all that was left was a front end web development
				 course so I decided to take that. I enjoyed that class a lot as well but part of me missed java and still seemed to like it better
				 than front end development. After my front end development class, life seemed to get in the way and I didn't do much coding of any
				 kind for quite a while. Luckily my problems all got sorted out and I was able to focus on returning to my chosen career path of being
				 a programmer. At the time I had felt like I had been set back quite a lot of time and my peers from high school were closer to their 
				 careers than I was. Thats when I found out about Grand Circus. The school was the best way to get me in the field I wanted to be apart
				 of and in relatively no time at all. I am very happy with my decision to attend Grand Circus and I cant wait to be able to call myself
				 a professional programmer.
